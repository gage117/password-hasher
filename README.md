# Password Hasher

A file I can easily grab and use to hash a single password or array of passwords using bcrypt.

## How to use

- Clone Repo
- Run `npm i` to install bcrypt module
- Run `node hashPassword.js [password(s)]`
    - The [password] option can take either a password string, or a stringified array of passwords to hash.
    - Alternatively for the array, you can copy/paste a JSON array into the `passwordArray` variable on line 10.
